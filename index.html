My love,

I recently have been enjoying writing letters for my special someone 🤔.  
Her name is Chaela, but I call her Aya, and somehow, I call her loveyy and baby 😭.

Merry Christmas MY LOVEYYYY 💕. We might not be together to say merry Christmas face to face, but I want you to know, the moment the clock turns 12, and the date turns into December 25, I hope you know that your name is the only thing in my mind. I hope you know that you were the first thing I thought of this Christmas. You matter so much to me, and I really can't fathom why you chose me ._., but I'm glad you did.

You're my everything, Aya. You make me wanna live a life with you, I want to be with you forever na, no refunds 😉. I hope as this year ends, you realize how proud I am of you, you realize that no matter what, on the good days or on the bad days, I will stay with you. And no matter what, I will choose you over and over again, every single living day. I'll be your shoulder to lean on when the world becomes a bit too hard to handle, I'll be your number 1 supporter babyy 😎. So don't doubt yourself, you yourself is enough na loveyy, don't be too harsh, okayy? You deserve soooo much, and I hope as we enter this new year, you stay with me and I will give you everything that you deserve, You deserve the world, baby. I'm so thankful for fate that we met, blessing me with such an exceptional and beautiful angel (you 😏) buti nalang tinadhana tayo, nu? In a world full of failed relationships, I hope that ours will be an exception. I hope that we'll see the day where monthsaries become anniversaries and I hope we'll grow old together ♥️♥️. Maybe the best things in life are those who you meet accidentally, and those who really loves mogu mogu (and likes Taylor Swift ._.)

"They say that in 2026, I should leave everything behind, the last year, the old chapters, the past. But if leaving means calling you my past, then I’d rather stay where time still knows your name 😌. If loving you means remaining in 2025, then 2025 is a beautiful place to exist 🤔. I won’t abandon you to yesterday, I’ll carry you gently into my next year, and into all the years we’re lucky enough to see together. ♥️"

-me, myself and I (your baby, your border collie 💞🤭)

You gave me the best Christmas present, Aya. It sounds corny but I really do think you're the best BEST gift I could ever ask for. You always have a special place in my heart. I wish you a merry, merry Christmas, wishing you blessings as I hold you from afar. Anyways, I'll be reading your letter now 😌. Love you my loveyy, for as long as the earth revolves around the sun 😭
